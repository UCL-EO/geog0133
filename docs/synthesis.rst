Synthesis
=========

So far in the course we have look at components of Terrestrial Carbon and Modelling and Monitoring methods in isolation. However, in many projects and papers these are brought together. Here we will present two case studies to summarise this synthesis process. 

CASE STUDY 1 - Forest Biomass and NPP

CASE STUDY 2 - Stomatal Conductance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stomatal conductance is the measure of gas exchange from the inside of a leaf to air around. Specifically, if is a measure of the rate of passage of carbon dioxide (CO2) exiting, or water vapor entering through the stomata of a leaf (e.g. in mmol m-2 s-2). The term conductance comes from analogy with electrical circuitry. It is controlled by the guard cells of the leaf stomata and controls transpiration rates and CO2 diffusion rates (along with gradients of water vapour and CO2).

Due to C02 restrictions on the rate of photosythesis, stomatal conductance is a crucial control of a plants NPP. Guard cells at a leafs stomata will close to conserve water within a plant. This process is a key part of the process of water stress stopping the productivity of a plant. The accurate modelling of stomatal conductance is therefore a key part of DGVMs.
